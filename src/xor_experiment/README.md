# Xor Experiment.

* Here we synthetically create an XOR dataset and perform distillation.
* Parameters can be setup and adjusted in ``globals.py``. 
* This is very initialization dependant, so run a few times to get it to work.
* Ideally, expert and novice should both produce 100% accuracy.
* Two tensorboards are available. ``judged`` or ``expert`` for each.
